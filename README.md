# Overview

This is a command-line implementation of Texas Hold'em poker written in Rust. You play against AI bots that react to how you're playing and what cards you have.

This project allowed me to get familiar with rust for the first time.

# Development Environment

All the development was done through WSL and vim.

The 'strum' crate was used which provides iterator functionality for enum types in rust.

# Future Work

- Get the flow right so there aare multiple rounds of betting per card flip instead of just one.
- Make it so three of a kind don't register as full houses
